Karen: Today was the day of my graduation, I came here, to say goodbye and parted. Knowing that the future was uncertain, other than I did not know.

Karen: I came here to say goodbye to Judith, the irony was that I never said goodbye to her. We were so close throughout my whole life.

Judith: Karen,great to see you. And where are you heading? After this, it is a medical school for me. 

Karen: Me too, we would never know when we would have such a chance again. 

Judith: Karen, where are you going? 

Karen: Probably to find work. 

Judith: That’s a waste, you have such excellent grades. You’re always behind me. 

Karen: And where are you heading? Is nursing school really that prestigious? 

Judith: I kind of wanted it, it makes me happy; it fulfills me, do you understand that, Karen? I could be anywhere, but I choose to be there. 

Karen: I get it, I get what you mean by that. 

Judith: Then, you must have something more. You can’t be just wanting it, not when you have so much. 

Karen: I know. Are your parents supportive? 

Judith: Whatever I want, provided there’s a future in it and I can go there. 

Karen: And there’s one in this? 

Judith: There’s one because I’m interested in helping people get better, Karen. And I can do this for the rest of my life. 

Karen: At the beck and call of doctors? 

Judith: Not even close, not even close. We’re independent, they give us orders but we’re not robots obeying their every whim, there is autonomy for us too. 

Karen: To take care of the ill and the injured. 

Judith: You interested. I’m planning to go to this school, here, take this brochure. Give yourself time to think it over. 

Karen: I will.

Karen: It might be a good idea, to take it. Somewhere to go, but perhaps the idea of a job where I can gain respect, and make my mom happy, that's good, isn�t it?

Karen: Let me fill up the application. I want to get in, I'll deal with mom after.

Karen: In the end, I got in; I went, much to the chagrin of my mother.

Karen: Let me fill up the application. I want to get in, I'll deal with mom after. 

Karen: In the end, I got in; I went, much to the chagrin of my mother. But after I convinced her, and she knew how good it was to be a nurse. And that I was interested in it. 

Karen: I was not doing it out of fear of never having something to call my own. It was never because of that.

# FirstDay

@back Antechamber id:Antechamber

Speaker: You are not here to do anything but to think of principles for a nurse. Care, concern, and following protocol and supporting doctors. 
What you can provide is a softer touch, something that a doctor might be unable to. 

Speaker: Be aware of that, the job will have long hours, shift work. It is a vocation, a dedication, and not something that you do because you have no choice. It is gruelling, it is tough.

Karen: How is it that Judith looks so good? But it's only with more difficulty that others would respect you, that it takes sopmeone and something special. 

Karen: She is certainly very good and happy about that.

Judith: How are you feeling? 

Karen: Like hell, but yet, I think I can make this work. 

Judith: I know you can, you know, I was always hoping that you would join me, you always seemed to fit in here. Where nothing ever changed you from taking charge. 

Judith: But I always dreamed it would be like this. 

Karen: You did?

Judith: I did in fact, ever since I knew that this was for me. 

@style color=#fed685,i

Karen: I never could understand how she was so certain about it. 

Karen: But ever since that moment, I have always found myself in a state where I could never understand her. This was the first time, where I think I did, that I think I did grasp my friend.

Judith: Class is sarting soon. Where have you been?
