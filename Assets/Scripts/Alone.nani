Karen: It was easy, my children hurt the most, they were so attentive, and so close to me when they were young, when they depended upon me for everything. Where I drove them around for a variety of soccer practice, music and more.

Karen: How about we go out today?

Angie: I'm going out with my friends.

Keith: Same. I'm going to a concert alone. Didnï¿½t we just go out a few days ago on Tuesday for Tacos?

Karen: Yes, I am aware, but I would like to spend time with you.

Angie: We'll see again, I'll like to not have it every week. Next week, I'll have someone different too.

Karen: They're growing up, but I feel so alone, I don't have anyone else left that I care about. Perhaps I need to make more of an attempt to get closer to them.

Karen: What about Thursday then?

Karen: I could do takeout during the end of Saturday?


Angie: I don't think I can make it.

Karen: I am alone, not even a single person to recover from, who else will bother with me now.
