Azrael: So, why are you here again? You keep saying that this is not worth your time.

Lucifer: Well, this is special. And Belphegor, that sloth has said the word to me again, that I'm not worth the title of the Prince of Hell.

Azrael: Keep telling yourself that. Or are you interested in humans?

Lucifer: I guess I enjoy watching someone beg for my mercy and kindness. But they all but bore more.

Azrael :I'm not sure she'll give it. You haven't even read her papers yet, from Azza.

Lucifer: She wrote one sentence. What did Tzadkiel write?

Azrael: A whole bloody report, three thousand words, Lucifer.

Lucifer: Azza said, "Enjoy the show!" I pity you, Azrael. You prefer competence

Azrael: Well, you read his report, and I'll look at hers.

Lucifer: Are you trying to? I'm trying to be a fair judge.

Azrael: You really don't want to know anything about her.

Lucifer: Not until they present themselves before me. They always beg that�s just who they are when they think they cannot win with me.

Azrael: Typically, I want to judge them fairly.

Lucifer: And therefore almost no one except me does it with you.

Azrael: You keep interrupting me.

Lucifer: For an angel, you keep forgetting about the whole mercy, redemption and second chances.

Azrael: That's because you don't have to face the performance tribunals, hell, no one is going to care. In fact, they yell at me for letting you be so lenient.

Lucifer: I am perfectly fair or rather sympathetic. It's not as though I have any law or moral code to abide by. 

Azrael: Not when they know how to talk, you let off a man who confessed to being an absolute serial killer because he had a cool story.

Lucifer: I mean, I think he was genuine.

Azrael: You do not know the trouble that gave me and how long they came up to.

Lucifer: Do you still prefer me or the other various princes of Hell?

Azrael: Still you.

Lucifer: We're always free to welcome you if you ever get bored with heaven.

Azrael: Yeah, still no. I am pretty grateful to them as a whole. You were always just too selfish to admit it.

Lucifer: So many of my brothers and sisters would go to disagree.

Azrael: As if.

Lucifer: Come on. Also, we should open the doors and allow the spirits to get settled in.

Azrael: Yes, because they need it as a break from hell.

Lucifer: Trust me, everyone needs more time away from hell.

Azrael: Sometimes I wonder whether you take this, so they stop pestering you.

Lucifer: I get the vast majority of souls.

Azrael: Indeed, you get the vast majority of souls because they are all unable to let go of their guilt and remorse.

Lucifer: Why is it my fault that you judge them so harshly?

Azrael: Thou shall not kill, steal, covet what is not theirs, accuse, jealous, beat, assault. So many things that they shouldn�t have done and yet they did them all.�

Lucifer:Then, they become my headaches.

Azrael: As they deserve to be.

Lucifer: So this is the chance to get rid of them. Besides, their commentary is golden.

Azrael: It's truly interesting to think about. Their words at least make this place a lot less difficult to bear.

Lucifer: So you admit that this was a good idea?

Azrael: ... 

Lucifer: Admit it. Admit that you want it.

Azrael: I'm not going to. Because it's a concession that I have to bow to.

Lucifer: Let them in, they're certainly done fast. 

Azrael: To you? I thought anything to you would feel like an eternity. 

Lucifer: Faster than I expected. Azza said there would be a show, so I expect it to be one.
